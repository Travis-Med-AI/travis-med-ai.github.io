# Contributing Models

New models can be added to travis med ai by submitting a pull request to our [models-repository](https://github.com/Travis-Med-AI/model-registry) in the following format:

```
model-title/
    manifest.json
```

At travis med ai, all models are hosted on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) as docker images. 
Your manifest.json file will contain all pertinent information for integrating your model into our system (i.e. location of the docker image, display name, etc.). More information on how to structure a manifest.json file is [below](#manifest-properties)

## Manifest Properties
